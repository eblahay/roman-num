roman-num
===============
a simple C++ program that takes decimal numbers as input and outputs corresponding
roman numerals of equal value.

I've also made an equivalent C++ static library.

TODO:
    - make the app dependent on the library & organize files accordingly

p.s
    I forgot to init repo when I started programming this — oops.
